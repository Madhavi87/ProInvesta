<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">What are mutual funds</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Mutual funds are in the form of Trust (usually called Asset Management Company) that manages the pool of money collected from various investors for investment in various classes of assets to achieve certain financial goals. We can say that Mutual Fund is trusts which pool the savings of large number of investors and then reinvests those funds for earning profits and then distribute the dividend among the investors. In return for such services, Asset Management Companies charge small fees. Every Mutual Fund / launches different schemes, each with a specific objective. Investors who share the same objectives invests in that particular Scheme. Each Mutual Fund Scheme is managed by a Fund Manager with the help of his team of professionals (One Fund Manage may be managing more than one scheme also).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Where does mutual funds invest money</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;">The Mutual Funds usually invest their funds in equities, bonds, debentures, call money etc., depending on the objectives and terms of scheme floated by a particular Mutual Fund scheme. Now a days there are Mutual Funds schemes which even invest in gold or other asset classes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">What are various types of mutual funds</span></strong> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mutual Funds can be classified into various categories under the following heads:- </span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><strong>According to the type of investment</strong> :- While launching a new scheme, every Mutual Fund is supposed to declare in the information brochure the kind of instruments in which it will make investments of the funds collected under that scheme. However, there are primarily 3 types of Mutual Fund schemes as categorized according to the type of investments as follows: -</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Equity oriented funds / schemes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Debt funds / schemes</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Balance funds (Having a mix of Equity and Debt) </span> </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><strong>According to the time of closure of the scheme : </strong> While launching new schemes, Mutual Funds also declare whether this will be an open ended scheme (i.e. there is no specific date when the scheme will be closed) or there is a closing date when finally the scheme will be wind up. Thus, according to the time of closure schemes are classified as follows: -</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Open ended schemes</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Close ended schemes</span> </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Open ended funds are allowed to issue and redeem units any time during the life of the scheme, but close ended funds cannot issue new units except in case of bonus or rights issue. Therefore, unit capital of open ended funds can fluctuate on daily basis (as new investors may purchase fresh units), but that is not the case for close ended schemes. In other words we can say that new investors can join the scheme by directly applying to the mutual fund at applicable net asset value related prices in case of open ended schemes but not in case of close ended schemes. In case of close ended schemes, new investors can buy the units only from secondary markets.</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><strong>According to the tax incentive schemes: </strong> Mutual Funds are also allowed to float some tax saving schemes. Therefore, sometimes the schemes are classified according to this also:-</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Tax Saving Schemes (Have a minimum lock-in of 3 years from date of investment)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Non Tax Saving Schemes / other funds</span></li>
</ul>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"><strong>Are Mutual Funds suitable for Small Investors or Big investors ? Why Should I Invest in a Mutual Fund when I can Invest Directly in the same stocks/instruments?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;">Like all other investments in equities and debts, the investments in Mutual funds also carry risk. However, investments through Mutual Funds is considered better due to the following reasons :-</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;">Your investments will be managed by professional finance managers who are in a better position to assess the risk profile of the investments;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In case you are a small investor, then your investment cannot be spread into equity shares of various good companies due to high price of such shares.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mutual Funds are in a much better position to effectively spread your investments across various sectors and among several products available in the market. This is called risk diversification and can effectively shield the steep slide in the value of your investments.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;">Thus, we can say that Mutual funds are better options for investments as they offer regular investors a chance to diversify their portfolios, which is something they may not be able to do if they decide to make direct investments in stock market or bond market. These are particularly good for small investors who have limited funds and are not aware of the intricacies of stock markets. For example, if you want to build a diversified portfolio of 20 scrips, you would probably need Rs 2,00,000 to get started (assuming that you make minimum investment of INR 10000 per scrip). However, you can invest in some of the diversified Mutual Fund schemes for as low as INR 10,000/-</span></p>
